# Docker Container Best Practices

Docker has become the de facto standard for containerization, but building efficient, secure, and maintainable containers requires following established best practices. This guide covers essential patterns for production-ready Docker containers.

## Image Optimization

### Multi-Stage Builds
Use multi-stage builds to reduce final image size by separating build dependencies from runtime dependencies.

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS production
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Base Image Selection
- Choose minimal base images (Alpine, Distroless)
- Keep base images updated
- Use official images when available
- Consider security implications

## Security Best Practices

### Non-Root Users
Always run containers as non-root users to minimize security risks.

```dockerfile
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
USER nextjs
```

### Image Scanning
- Regularly scan images for vulnerabilities
- Use tools like Trivy or Snyk
- Implement security policies in CI/CD

### Secrets Management
- Never embed secrets in images
- Use Docker secrets or external secret management
- Use build-time secrets appropriately

## Performance Optimization

### Layer Caching
Structure Dockerfile to maximize layer caching efficiency by ordering commands from least to most frequently changing.

### Resource Limits
Set appropriate CPU and memory limits to prevent resource contention.

```dockerfile
# In docker-compose.yml
services:
  app:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.50'
          memory: 512M
```

## Health Checks

Implement proper health checks for reliable container orchestration.

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1
```

## Logging and Monitoring

### Structured Logging
- Log to STDOUT/STDERR
- Use structured logging formats (JSON)
- Implement proper log levels

### Observability
- Expose metrics endpoints
- Implement distributed tracing
- Monitor container performance

## Production Deployment

### Container Orchestration
- Use orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Implement proper service discovery
- Configure load balancing

### Rolling Updates
- Implement zero-downtime deployments
- Use readiness and liveness probes
- Configure proper update strategies

## Development Workflow

### Docker Compose
Use Docker Compose for local development environments that mirror production.

### Volume Mounts
- Use named volumes for persistent data
- Implement proper backup strategies
- Consider volume performance implications

## Common Pitfalls

### Image Size Issues
- Avoid including unnecessary files
- Use .dockerignore files
- Clean up package managers caches

### Security Vulnerabilities
- Regularly update base images
- Scan for known vulnerabilities
- Implement least privilege principles

## Conclusion

Following these Docker best practices will help you build secure, efficient, and maintainable containerized applications that perform well in production environments. Remember that containerization is just one part of a complete DevOps strategy.
